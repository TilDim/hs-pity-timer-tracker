# Hearthstone Pity Timer Tracker
Helps you keep track of the pity timers in Hearthstone

What is a pity timer?

When you open card packs in Hearthstone, you are guaranteed to find an epic card within 10 packs and a legendary one within 40. This is called a pity timer and there is one for each expansion.

This program has a pity timer tracker for both epic and legendary cards of every expansion and a total packs counter for each expansion to keep track of how many packs you open.

How to install:

No installation required for this program to work. Just download and run the .jar file anywhere in your system.

How it works:

For each expansion there is a dedicated panel containing:
1) The icon of the expansion, which is a link to the expansion's official website (except 'Classic')
2) A pity timer tracker for epic cards with buttons to modify the tracker and a label displaying the probability of finding an epic card in the next pack
3) A pity timer tracker for legendary cards with buttons to modify the tracker and a label displaying the probability of finding a legendary card in the next pack
4) A total packs counter with buttons and fields to modify the counter and four buttons, each one being a link to the 'Common', 'Rare', 'Epic' and 'Legendary' cards 
   of the expansion respectively

This program does not operate automatically. All the timers and counters are modified manually by the user with the use of buttons.
